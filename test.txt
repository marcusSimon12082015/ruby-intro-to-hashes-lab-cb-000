working with hashes
  instantiating
    #new_hash
      creates an empty hash and returns it
  instantiating a hash with ONE key-value pair
    #actor
      creates a hash named actor whose key is a symbol :name and whose value is a string, 'Dwayne The Rock Johnson'

building a multidimensional monopoly hash
  adding a key-value pair to the top level of the monopoly hash
    #monopoly
      adds a key-value pair to the monopoly hash. The key should be :railroads and the value should be an empty hash
  adding key-value pairs to the second level of the monopoly hash that we started building in the #monopoly method
    #monopoly_with_second_tier
      sets the first key of the :railroads hash to a symbol, :pieces, whose value is the integer 4
      sets the second key of the :railroads hash to a symbol, :names, whose value is an empty hash
      sets the third key of the :railroads hash to a symbol, :rent_in_dollars, whose value is an empty hash (FAILED - 1)
